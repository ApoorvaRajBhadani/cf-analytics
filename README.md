**Analyse Codeforces profiles**

CF Analytics extension/add-on improves the [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) profile webpage to include statistics of problems solved by the user. The *Problem Rating* graph is a bar chart showing problems solved for each problem rating. The *Tags Solved* graph is a doughnut chart displaying tags solved across any problem and also lists a count for each tag. The *Unsolved Problems* shows a count of all problems attempted with not correct verdict and also lists them.

## How does it works?
The extension runs entirely on the browser and communicates only with the [Codeforces API](https://codeforces.com/apiHelp) to get the raw data.

It processes the raw data to create charts/graphs and lists.
